    <h2 style="color: darkblue;">what are the Predictions for A.I in the future?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Computers will solve all problems known to the human race</h3></li>
        <p>We will create systems and robots, which are smarter than us. According to Ray Kurzweil, one of the most-known futurists, computers will have the same level of intelligence as humans by 2045. This point of evolution is called by some scientists as the Singularity.

            Using big data, computer programs (or artificial intelligence) will be capable of analysing massive amounts of information, identifying trends and using that knowledge to come up with solutions to the world’s biggest problems, such as hunger, diseases, climate change, overpopulation, etc.</p>
    <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Machines will become our best friends, advisors, and caretakers</h3></li>
    <p>We are social beings and need other people. Yet, increasingly many of us seem to be more comfortable dealing with people via devices rather than in person. As machines get more intelligent and can better adapt to its users, people may end up preferring to interact with machines over people. Moreover, robots and AI could provide excellent care and support for the elderly, the ill, and disabled.</p>
    <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Humans do not have to work anymore</h3></li>
    <p>The way we work has changed throughout the history – from agriculture to the industrial revolution to knowledge workers. It is quite easy for machines and automation to replace recurring and routine tasks, such as assembling products, mowing a lawn, sending out emails, and even driving, doing surgery and research.</p>
    <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">We will all become cyborgs, enhanced by technology</h3></li>
    <p>Our minds and bodies will be enhanced by prosthetics and implants giving us infallible functions and motorics. Technology could cure us of deadly injuries, replace our limbs and organs, or give us sensory abilities far beyond existing vision, hearing, and manipulation. These future systems will be enabled via robotics, augmented reality, neuroscience, 3D printing, programming, material design, etc.</p>
