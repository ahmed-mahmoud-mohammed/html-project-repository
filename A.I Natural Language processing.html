        <h2 style="color: darkblue;">What Is Natural Language Processing?</h2>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that studies how machines understand human language. Its goal is to build systems that can make sense of text and perform tasks like translation, grammar checking, or topic classification.</p>
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) makes it possible for computers to understand the human language.

    Probably, the most popular examples of NLP in action are virtual assistants, like Google Assist, Siri, and Alexa. NLP understands and translates the human language, like “Hey Siri, where is the nearest gas station?” into numbers, making it easy for machines to understand.
    
    Another well-known application of NLP are chatbots, which can help you solve issues while performing natural language generation – in other words, holding a conversation in plain English!
    
    There are many other everyday apps you use, where you’ve probably encountered NLP without even noticing. Text recommendations when writing an email, offering to translate a Facebook post written in a different language, or filtering unwanted promotional emails into your spam folder. 
    
    In a nutshell, the goal of Natural Language Processing is to make human language ‒ which is complex, ambiguous, and extremely diverse ‒ easy for machines to understand. 
    
    How does it work? First, it applies linguistics to analyze the grammatical structure and the meaning of words, then it uses algorithms to build intelligent systems capable of performing different tasks.</p>

<h2 style="color: darkblue;">5 Use Cases of NLP in Business</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Sentiment Analysis</h3></li>
    <p>Sentiment analysis identifies emotions in text and classifies opinions as positive, negative, or neutral. You can see how it works by pasting text into this free sentiment analysis tool.</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Language Translation</h3></li>
<p>Translation tools enable businesses to communicate in different languages, helping them improve their global communication or break into new markets.</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Text Extraction</h3></li>
<p>Text extraction enables you to pull out pre-defined information from text. If you deal with large amounts of data, this tool helps you recognize and extract relevant keywords and features (like product codes, colors, and specs), and named entities (like names of people, locations, company names, emails, etc).</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Chatbots</h3></li>
<p>Chatbots are AI systems designed to interact with humans through text or speech.</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Topic Classification</h3></li>
<p>Topic classification helps you organize unstructured text into categories. For companies, it’s a great way of gaining insights from customer feedback.</p>
