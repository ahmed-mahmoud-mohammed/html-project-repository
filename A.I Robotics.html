        <h2 style="color: darkblue;">How Artificial Intelligence is Used in Today’s Robots</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are a powerful combination for automating tasks inside and outside of the factory setting. In recent years, AI has become an increasingly common presence in robotic solutions, introducing flexibility and learning capabilities in previously rigid applications.
            While AI is still in its nascent stages, it’s been a transformative technology for some applications in the manufacturing sector, although there are many that have yet to feel the impact.</p>
   <h2 style="color: darkblue;">4 Robotic Applications that Use Artificial Intelligence</h2>
   <ol>
       <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Assembly</h3></li>
       <p>AI is a highly useful tool in robotic assembly applications. When combined with advanced vision systems, AI can help with real-time course correction, which is particularly useful in complex manufacturing sectors like aerospace. AI can also be used to help a robot learn on its own which paths are best for certain processes while it’s in operation.</p>
  <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Packaging</h3></li>
  <p>Robotic packaging uses forms of AI frequently for quicker, lower cost and more accurate packaging. AI helps save certain motions a robotic system makes, while constantly refining them, which makes installing and moving robotic systems easy enough for anybody to do.</p>
   <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Customer Service</h3></li>
   <p>Robots are now being used in a customer service capacity in retail stores and hotels around the world. Most of these robots leverage AI natural language processing abilities to interact with customers in a more human way. Often, the more these systems can interact with humans, the more they learn.</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Open Source Robotics</h3></li>
<p>A handful of robotic systems are now being sold as open source systems with AI capability. This way, users can teach their robots to do custom tasks based on their specific application, such as small-scale agriculture. The convergence of open source robotics and AI could be a huge trend in the future of AI robots.

    When working together, robots are smarter, more accurate and more profitable. AI has yet to come close to reaching its full potential, but as it advances, so will robotics.</p>
</ol>
<h2 style="color: darkblue;">What the Future Holds for robotics</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Sense and Response</h3></li>
    <p>Modern robots when fitted with sensors are programmable via AI to pinpoint a specific object despite its location on the working space.</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Mobility</h3></li>
<p>Robots have exhibited mobility capabilities for over six decades. However, AI makes it possible for robots to achieve precise mobility in complex and unpredictable environments.</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Handling Hazardous Tasks</h3></li>
<p>Robots of the future will have the capacity to take over risky jobs like handling radioactive substances or disabling bombs. In addition, AI robots can withstand working in unfavorable environments such as extremely noisy conditions, scorching heat, and toxic environments. Consequently, AI robots will save countless lives.</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Robots and Humans in a Shared Workplace</h3></li>
<p>Humans and robots will interact in a shared workplace. In fact, some companies have already started setting the trend towards this revolution by having robots as shop attendants. Humans will increasingly interact with autonomous robots that handle tasks like restocking the workstations.</p>
<li><h3 style="color: darkred;">Process Optimization</h3></li>
<p>AI has been used to ensure optimum reliability and accuracy in robots. Manufacturers in the robotics industry use AI intelligence to figure out the appropriate timespan for providing holistic maintenance of the robots. This helps the customers avoid unnecessary breakdowns and the associated costs of major repairs.</p>
